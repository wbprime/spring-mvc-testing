# spring-mvc-testing

Rewrite of project [pkainulainen/spring-mvc-test-examples](https://github.com/pkainulainen/spring-mvc-test-examples), adding more concrete examples to demonstrate how to write Spring MVC projects together with StandAlone/WebApplicationSetup test.

The target is to cover both unit test and integration test.  Spring related code is about to be implemented as Java-based configuration and XML-based configuration.

Currently there are 4 demo projects and 1 common project.

- [spring-mvc-test-common](https://github.com/wbprime/spring-mvc-testing/tree/master/spring-mvc-test-common)
    Common and shareed controllers/services used by other projects
- [spring-mvc-controllers-unit-test-java](https://github.com/wbprime/spring-mvc-testing/tree/master/spring-mvc-controllers-unit-test-java)
    Spring MVC based webapp with JSP view technology using Java Configuration for both dev and test
- [spring-mvc-controllers-unit-test-xml](https://github.com/wbprime/spring-mvc-testing/tree/master/spring-mvc-controllers-unit-test-xml)
    Spring MVC based webapp with JSP view technology using XML Configuration for both dev and test
- [spring-mvc-rest-unit-test-java](https://github.com/wbprime/spring-mvc-testing/tree/master/spring-mvc-rest-unit-test-java)
    Spring MVC based webapp for REST api using Java Configuration for both dev and test
- [spring-mvc-rest-unit-test-xml](https://github.com/wbprime/spring-mvc-testing/tree/master/spring-mvc-rest-unit-test-xml)
    Spring MVC based webapp for REST api using XML Configuration for both dev and test
